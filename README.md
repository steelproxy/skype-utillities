# SkypeUtilities
This is a trolling tool I hacked together from a bunch of StackOverflow posts when I was about 13, it is not the highest quality code by any means, and should not be used in any fashion, but instead kept as a reminder of a bygone era.

# Features
- Reads contact list for selectively targeting user(s) for spam
- Forging qutoes via special clipboard methods

# Installation
Skype doesn't exist anymore so I fail to see any use for this.
